  :robot: Machine learning challenge - wine quality
</h1>

## :pencil2: Description: 

- The dataset “Wine Quality” is available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine). 
- This dataset contains a set of
attributes (sensor data) about the winemaking process (red and white).
- These data are used to classify, at the end of the process, the quality of the wine
obtained.

## :dart: Goals - Exercise the following concepts: 

- EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data preparation
- Comparison and adjustment of classification models.

- [x] Data processing with Pandas
- [x] Pearson's correlation coefficient
- [x] KNN Algorithm
- [x] how to select the optimal K value?
- [x] Decision Tree Algorithm
- [x] Random Forest Algorithm
- [x] SVM Algorithm
- [x] MLP Network Algorithm
